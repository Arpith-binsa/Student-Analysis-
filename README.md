This is a short analysis done to study if sleep has significant effect on grades, Or if that time spent studying would be more effective even if you get less than ideal sleeping hours.

The study is done using the data collected from a group of Stanford Students by a colleague, Who did MSc Computer Science Programme in Stanford

The DataSet contains The Hours done Studying and Hours slept, as well as grades including the attendance Grades, The previous exam Grades and the main Exam Grades done after the Data of Sleep and Study was collected

My program will try see if People Who spent time sleeping more got any significantly higher grades that people who utilised that time studying
